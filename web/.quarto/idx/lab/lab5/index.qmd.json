Use your MCU, an LM386 audio amplifier, and an 8-ohm speaker. The MCU should read a list of notes specifying the pitch (in Hz) and duration (in ms) of each note. It should generate a corresponding sequence of square waves. A frequency of 0 indicates a rest (silence for the given duration). A duration of 0 indicates the end of the song. Your system should play accurate pitches regardless of the frequency. Test your system on the score of Für Elise, which is provided. Your code should manually define #define macros and register structures for the memory-mapped registers you need to manipulate to help you practice developing your own device drivers from scratch using only the reference manual as a reference. In particular, this means that you are not allowed to use the CMSIS headers for your device.\n\n\n# Discussion\n\nYou can find `lab5_starter.c` on the class web page with the Für Elise score provided as an array of ordered pairs of pitch frequencies and durations.\n\nA goal of this lab is for you to learn to interpret a datasheet and figure out how the timer works. Write your own code from scratch to use the system timer.\n\nThe GPIO pins don’t generate enough output current to play satisfactory music directly on the speaker, so use an LM386 audio amplifier between the MCU and the speaker. Do not connect the MCU directly to the speaker, as the current draw could damage it. The datasheet shows AC coupling from the amplifier to the speaker, but you can leave out the capacitors and resistors and produce an acceptable square wave. Volume control is optional (but recommended for your own sanity and that of your roommates and labmates). There are only a limited number of speakers available in the lab so please leave the speakers in the supply cabinet when you leave the lab. Do not leave them attached to your breadboard when you are done working. If you kill a speaker, throw it away rather than putting it back in the cabinet for your unfortunate classmates.\n\n\n# Extra Credit\n\nUp to one point of extra credit can be earned if you compose and play a different tune. The following information may help as you compose your music.\n\nThe duration depends on an arbitrary choice of tempo (speed at which the piece is played). If a whole note is chosen to be 1/2 a second long, other notes follow accordingly:\n\n::: {.center-table}\n| Note Type | Duration [s] |\n|:---------:|:------------:|\n| Whole     |      0.5     |\n| Half      |     0.25     |\n| Quarter   |     0.125    |\n| Eighth    |    0.0625    |\n| Sixteenth |    0.03125   |\n\n:::\n\nRecall that the A above middle C (called A4) is 440 Hz (at least in the United States) and that an octave spans a factor of 2 in frequency.
